Aisleway
=========
***

Component based services for building e-commerce functionality in Ruby.

## Installation

## Usage

### Architecture

Aisleway is mostly made up of several standard e-commerce models which can be pieced together using several different backends so that they can be used easily inside [Rails](http://github.com/rails/rails), [Sinatra](http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) or other plain old Ruby Rack-based servers.

Aisleway also contains an API wrapper that can be used to serve up RESTful JSON responses for use with mobile applications.

To interact with Aisleway, an Aisleway command line interface allows you to easily add products, check orders, check on customers, etc.
